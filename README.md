##Project Overview

The Healthcare Data Analysis project utilizes Power BI to analyze and derive insights from healthcare data. The project aims to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations within the data to improve decision-making and operational efficiency in healthcare organizations. By leveraging Power BI's visualization capabilities, we create interactive dashboards that provide valuable insights into patient demographics,hospital utilization, and other key healthcare metrics.

## Key Findings

1. **Patient Demographics**: Identified trends in age distribution and gender disparities among patients.
2. **Treatment Costs**: Analyzed costs associated with different treatments and procedures to identify areas for optimization.
3. **Hospital Utilization**: Explored patterns in hospital admissions and room occupancy to improve resource allocation.
4. **Doctor's Impact**: Investigated the influence of doctors on patient recovery rates and treatment outcomes.

## Data Analysis and Visualization

1. **Age Groups and Length of Stay:**
    - Categorized patients into age groups: Child, Adult, and Senior.
    - Found that seniors had the longest hospital stays on average.

2. **Treatment Costs:**
    - Analyzed average treatment costs across different categories.
    - Discovered that medication was the costliest treatment category.
3. **Recovery Rating Analysis:**
    - Studied average recovery ratings across different treatment types.
    - Found that counseling treatment exhibited the highest average recovery rating.

4. **Hospital Utilization Analysis:**
    - Analyzed admissions and room occupancy across hospitals.
    - Identified Green Valley Medical Centre with the highest number of admissions.

5. **Doctor's Patient Load:**
    - Explored patient count and recovery rating for different doctors.
    - Noticed variations in recovery ratings among different doctors.

6. **Treatment Effectiveness:**
    - Examined recovery ratings and length of stay for various treatment types.
    - Surgery showed the lowest recovery rating despite the longest length of stay.

7. **Cost Analysis by Hospital:**
    - Compared average treatment costs across hospitals.
    - Cedar Sinai Clinic emerged as the most expensive hospital.

8. **Patient Admission Trends Over Time:**
    - Studied trends in patient admissions over the year.
    - Observed a consistent pattern in patient admissions with a slight decrease in February.

9. **Correlation Between Age and Recovery:**
    - Investigated correlation between age and recovery ratings.
    - Found no direct correlation between age and recovery ratings.
      
10. **Advanced DAX: Length of Stay and Cost Correlation:**
    - Calculated correlation between length of stay and total bill.
    - Found a moderate positive correlation between the two variables.

   ## Tools and Skills

- **Power BI**: Utilized Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted thorough analysis of healthcare data to extract meaningful insights.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applied statistical techniques to identify correlations and trends within the data.
- **Domain Knowledge**: Leveraged domain knowledge in healthcare to interpret findings and provide context to the analysis.

## Takeaways

- Power BI enables healthcare organizations to gain valuable insights from their data, leading to improved patient care and operational efficiency.
- Understanding patient demographics and treatment patterns is essential for optimizing healthcare delivery and resource allocation.
